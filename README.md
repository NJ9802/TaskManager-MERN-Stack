# Task Manager

Task Manager is my first web application built on the MERN Stack, serving as a testament to my growing expertise in these technologies. This simple web application allows users to perform CRUD operations on the database and utilizes JWT authentication to protect access to the API.

As a demonstration of my skills in web development, Task Manager showcases my ability to create dynamic, responsive, and efficient web applications. This project has enabled me to gain practical experience in the development process, from design ( If it looks good, it's probably because I copied it from somewhere. XD ) to deployment.

Task Manager is a great starting point for those looking to delve into the world of web development. With its comprehensive functionality and intuitive interface, this application provides a solid foundation for those seeking to learn more about the MERN Stack and web development in general.

Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to refine your skills or a beginner looking to get started, Task Manager is the perfect project to showcase your abilities and demonstrate your knowledge of the MERN Stack.
